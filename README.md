# Customer Churn Prediction ðŸ¤”

## Description
This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning models. The dataset used is the WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv file, which contains customer information and service usage details. The pipeline involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

* **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing and erroneous data,
encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder,
removing unnecessary features (e.g., customerID),
addressing class imbalance using SMOTE.
* **Feature Engineering:** Histogram and boxplot visualizations for numerical columns, correlation heatmaps for feature selection.
*  **Machine Learning Models:** Models trained: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation.
* **Model Evaluation:** Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, predicted churn probability for new inputs.
* **Pickle Integration:** Encoders and the trained model are saved and loaded using pickle for future predictions.
